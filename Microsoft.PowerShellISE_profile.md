# Profile for Microsoft PowerShell ISE

## Introduction

I made this profile for myself to help me with PowerShell ISE v5.
I provide it as is, so do what you want with it.

## Installation for Windows

### Where to put the PS1 Profile

According to Microsoft.
You have to put it in this directory (mandatory) :


```
📂 C:/
│
└── 📂 Users
    │
    └── 📂 User - [environment]::GetFolderPath('User')
        │
        └── 📂 MyDocuments - [environment]::GetFolderPath('Personal')
            │
            └── 📂 WindowsPowerShell
                │
                └── 📄 Microsoft.PowerShellISE_profile.ps1
```


### Naming the file (Mandatory)

The name of the file MUST be "Microsoft.PowerShellISE_profile.ps1".

Otherwise, this doesn't works.
